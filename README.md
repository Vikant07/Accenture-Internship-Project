 ## **Project Information**
 Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media and content creation platform, is overcoming critical challenges. The company faces issues of managing immense data volumes, resource constraints despite its exponential growth, and the impending complexity of preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Founded in 2010 by former engineers from a prominent social media conglomerate, Social Buzz emphasizes content over individual user identity, garnering over 500 million active monthly users. With the majority of its workforce dedicated to technical operations, Social Buzz now seeks external expertise to navigate its scaling demands and ensure a successful transition to a publicly traded company.
